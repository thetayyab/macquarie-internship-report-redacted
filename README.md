Internship Report Cybersecurity Risk Management and Framework Adaptation for Small Businesses

Hi, I’m Tayyab. This repo includes a redacted version of my Macquarie University cybersecurity internship report and supporting artifacts.

During my internship, I completed OSINT-based security assessments for two organisations (healthcare and education) using passive methods only. I documented exposures, assessed risk, mapped findings to NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) functions and subcategories, and wrote practical recommendations that fit resource-limited environments. 
I also handled a real phishing email case, escalated it, and produced a short analysis report.
